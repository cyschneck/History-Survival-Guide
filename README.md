**About This Project**

This is a science and history blog that explores scientific concepts coupled with practical information about how to recreate and use the techniques described by hand.  The History Survival Guide (or,  A Time Traveler’s Guide to Surviving History) has been updating since July 2019. Each page is the accumulation of research for a particular topic, synthesized and summarized in a useful ‘survival guide’ format. So far, topics covered included using the proper motion of stars to determine what time period a time traveler could have found themselves in, deciphering ‘Hobo Symbols’ of the 1800’s, and how to read the Pioneer Plaque. All pages are done in a pulp science fiction aesthetic.
